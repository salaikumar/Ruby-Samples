# Ruby code for simple Math.
# PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction 
#puts "5 + 7"  5+7;


puts 5 + 7 # this works. 

puts "5 + 7 = #{5+7}"

# puts "5 + 7 = " + 5+7  this is not possible as well.  No String concatenation like this in ruby

puts  3 > 2

# A simple if block.. Yah!
#if (3 > 2)
#puts 3
#else
#  puts 2
#end  

# A piece of code for Operator Precedence
puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# To predict Operator precedence
puts 5 + 4 % 3  # Output is  6 .. % has higher priority.

puts 6 / 3 + 4 # Output is 6 . '/' has higher priority
