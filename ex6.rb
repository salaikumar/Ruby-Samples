# Some string excersise
#  + is introduced

puts "hello " + "World" + "!"

puts 'hello ' + 'World' + '!2'  # Both works
# Similarly , this concatenates the string

hel = "hello"
wor = "World"

puts  hel + wor

# will this work?
#puts hel + 4  # No. You can concatenate only strings. `+': no implicit conversion of Fixnum into String (TypeError)

# boolean value assignments are also brought in.
hilarious = false  # simple true and false .. thats it

puts hilarious
